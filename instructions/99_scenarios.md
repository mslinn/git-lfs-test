# Next Steps

1. Add remote repository setup automation:
   - Auto-create bare repos for local scenarios
   - Configure remote URLs in git
   - Enable actual push/pull operations
2. Add LFS server configuration helpers:
   - Start/stop LFS test servers
   - Verify server availability
   - Auto-configure server URLs
3. Implement scenario-specific configurations:
   - Server-specific setup (lfs-test-server, giftless, rudolfs)
   - Protocol-specific handling (http, https, ssh)
4. Add comprehensive error recovery:
   - Cleanup on failure
   - Resume capability
   - Rollback mechanisms
5. Refactor for short-lived database connections:
   - Open/close DB per operation instead of holding throughout test
   - Improves concurrency for long-running tests
6. Add more reporting and comparison tools:
   - Detailed timing analysis
   - Performance comparisons between scenarios
   - Storage efficiency metrics
